## Quest <a id="Quest"></a>##

Quests are what GeoQuest is all about. For the users they are the basic entities which can be played or consumed. Examples for quests are [tours](#Tour) or games. Quests are accessed through a  player which runs on a mobile device. They are represented by their name and author. They may (in the future) have additional information like a logo, category or a rating.

Quests can be located, i.e. they can only be used on a certain location. Some quests, however, are usable independent of the user's location. 

Each quest can be thought of as an app on its own which solely offers this quest. This makes sense in particular for large, complex quests which offer a high degree of freedom on its own and of coarse for branded quests by commercial providers. An example is the [Radioranzen](http://www.radioranzen.de/) app by [Q3](http://www.qdrei.info/).

## Tour <a id="Tour"></a>##

A tour is a [quest](#Quest) that focuses on explaining or telling the user something about certain places. Typical examples are *sightseeing tours* in a city or region or thematic *educational tours* in a museum or cultural heritage site. Its focus is on transferring knowledge and it pursues a target. This makes it different from a game.
